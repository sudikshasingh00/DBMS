      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner.
         It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.
          DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in coinvent and efficient manner.
        
        
     Key Features of DBMS
    Data modeling: A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.
     Data storage and retrieval: A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.
     Concurrency control: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other. 
     Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data. 
     Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure. 
    DBMS can be classified into two types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL) RDBMS: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns.
    The data are related to each other through primary and foreign keys. NoSQL: Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based. 
    These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios. 
     A database is a collection of interrelated data which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from the database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports, etc. 
    For Example, a university database organizes the data about students, faculty, admin staff, etc. which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from it.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Aplications">
      <h2>Aplications</h2>
      <p>Applications of DBMS:
       Enterprise Information: Sales, accounting, human resources, Manufacturing, online retailers.
       Banking and Finance Sector: Banks maintaining the customer details, accounts, loans, banking transactions, credit card transactions.
       Finance: Storing the information about sales and holdings, purchasing of financial stocks and bonds. 
       University: Maintaining the information about student course enrolled information, student grades, staff roles. 
       Airlines: Reservations and schedules. Telecommunications: Prepaid, postpaid bills maintance.
       Paradigm Shift from File System to DBMS File System manages data using files on a hard disk. 
       Users are allowed to create, delete, and update the files according to their requirements. 
      Let us consider the example of file-based University Management System. 
      Data of students is available to their respective Departments, Academics Section, Result Section, Accounts Section, Hostel Office, etc.
      Some of the data is common for all sections like Roll No, Name, Father Name, Address, and Phone number of students but some data is available to a particular section only like Hostel allotment number which is a part of the hostel office.
      Let us discuss the issues with this system: Redundancy of data: Data is said to be redundant if the same data is copied at many places. 
      if a student wants to change their Phone number, he or she has to get it updated in various sections. Similarly, old records must be deleted from all sections representing that student. 
      Inconsistency of Data: Data is said to be inconsistent if multiple copies of the same data do not match each other.
      If the Phone number is different in Accounts Section and Academics Section, it will be inconsistent. 
      Inconsistency may be because of typing errors or not updating all copies of the same data.
       Difficult Data Access: A user should know the exact location of the file to access data, so the process is very cumbersome and tedious.
      If the user wants to search the student hostel allotment number of a student from 10000 unsorted students’ records, how difficult it can be. 
      Unauthorized Access: File Systems may lead to unauthorized access to data. If a student gets access to a file having his marks, he can change it in an unauthorized way.
      No Concurrent Access: The access of the same data by multiple users at the same time is known as concurrency.
      The file system does not allow concurrency as data can be accessed by only one user at a time.
         No Backup and Recovery: The file system does not incorporate any backup and recovery of data if a file is lost or corrupted</p>

      <h2>Advantages</h2>
      <p>Advantages of DBMS
        Data organization: A DBMS allows for the organization and storage of data in a structured manner, making it easy to retrieve and query the data as needed. Data integrity: A DBMS provides mechanisms for enforcing data integrity constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data. Concurrent access: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other. Data security: A DBMS provides tools for managing the security of the data, such as controlling access to the data and encrypting sensitive data. Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure. Data sharing: A DBMS allows multiple users to access and share the same data, which can be useful in a collaborative work environment.</p>

      <h2>sQl Learning Tips</h2>
      <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is a computer language that we use to interact with a relational database. SQL is a tool for organizing, managing, and retrieving archived data from a computer database. The original name was given by IBM as Structured English Query Language, abbreviated by the acronym SEQUEL. When data needs to be retrieved from a database, SQL is used to make the request. The DBMS processes the SQL query retrieves the requested data and returns it to us. Rather, SQL statements describe how a collection of data should be organized or what data should be extracted or added to the database.

      </p>
      <br><h2>What are the characteristics of SQL?</h2></br>
      <p>SQL may be utilized by quite a number of users, which include people with very little programming experience. SQL is a non-procedural language. We can without difficulty create and replace databases in SQL. It isn’t a time-consuming process. SQL is primarily based totally on ANSI standards. SQL does now no longer have a continuation individual. SQL is entered into the SQL buffer on one or more lines. SQL makes use of a termination individual to execute instructions immediately. It makes use of features to carry out a few formatting. It uses functions to perform some formatting.</p></br>
    <br><h2>Uses of SQL</h2></br>
    <p>Data definition: It is used to define the structure and organization of the stored data and the relationships among the stored data items. Data retrieval: SQL can also be used for data retrieval. Data manipulation: If the user wants to add new data, remove data, or modifying in existing data then SQL provides this facility also. Access control: SQL can be used to restrict a user’s ability to retrieve, add, and modify data, protecting stored data against unauthorized access. Data sharing: SQL is used to coordinate data sharing by concurrent users, ensuring that changes made by one user do not inadvertently wipe out changes made at nearly the same time by another user. SQL also differs from other computer languages because it describes what the user wants the computer to do rather than how the computer should do it. (In more technical terms, SQL is a declarative or descriptive language rather than a procedural one.) SQL contains no IF statement for testing conditions, and no GOTO, DO, or FOR statements for program flow control. Rather, SQL statements describe how a collection of data is to be organized, or what data is to be retrieved or added to the database. The sequence of steps to do those tasks is left for the DBMS to determine.</p>

      <p>L/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL
        with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to oracle engine
        all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic.<br>
        <h2>Basics of PL/SQL</h2><br>
        •PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL).
        PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.
        Oracle uses a PL/SQL engine to processes the PL/SQL statements.
        PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. It allows
        declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers.<br>
        <h2>Features of PL/SQL:</h2><br>
PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision
making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages.
PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.
One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types,
which are stored in the database for reuse by applications.
PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as
exception handling block.
Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where
Oracle is operational.
PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.<br>

            SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31';<br>
          
      <h4>UNION Operator</h4><br>
      The UNION operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements.<br>
      
            SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics'
            UNION
            SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE category = 'Appliances';<br>
          
      <h4>EXISTS Operator</h4><br>
      The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any rows in a subquery.<br>
      
            SELECT * FROM orders WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id);<br>
          
      <h4>ANY Operator</h4><br>
      The ANY operator is used to compare a value to any value in a list or returned by a subquery.<br>
      
            SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > ANY (SELECT price FROM competitors);<br>
          
      <h4>ALL Operator</h4><br>
      The ALL operator is used to compare a value to every value in a list or returned by a subquery.<br>
      
            SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > ALL (SELECT price FROM competitors);<br>

    <p><h4>Cursors</h4>
      <h4>Cursors are essential constructs that allow us to work with query results row by row. </h4><br>
      Here’s what you need to know:<br>
  



<h4> Implicit Cursors:</h4><br>
  Implicit cursors are automatically created by PL/SQL when executing SQL statements.<br>
  They manage the result set of a query without explicit declaration.<br>
  Common scenarios for implicit cursors include INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.<br>

<h5>Key attributes:</h5><br>
  %FOUND: True if the most recent SQL operation affected at least one row.
  %NOTFOUND: True if no rows were affected.
  %ROWCOUNT: Returns the number of rows affected.
  %ISOPEN: Checks if the cursor is open.<br>


 <h4>Explicit Cursors:<h4><br>

  Explicit cursors are created by users when needed.
  They allow fetching data from a table row by row.
  Steps to create an explicit cursor:<br>

  <h5>declare cursor object:</h5><br>
  
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM table_name;<br>
  


  <h5>open cursor:</h5><br>
  
OPEN cursor_name;<br>
  

  <h4>Fetch Data from the Cursor (Methods):</h4><br>
  *FIRST: Fetch the first row.
  *LAST: Fetch the last row.
  *NEXT: Fetch data in a forward direction.
  *PRIOR: Fetch data in a backward direction.
  *ABSOLUTE n: Fetch the exact nth row.
  *RELATIVE n: Fetch data incrementally or decrementally.<br>

  <h4>close cursor:</h4><br>
  
CLOSE cursor_name;<br>
  

  <h4>dealocate cursor:</h4><br>
  
DEALLOCATE cursor_name;<br>
  



<h4> example of implicit cursor:</h4><br>
BEGIN
FOR emp_rec IN SELECT * FROM emp LOOP
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee name: ' || emp_rec.ename);
END LOOP;
END;<br>



<h4> example of explicit cursor:</h4><br>

DECLARE
s1 CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM studDetails;
BEGIN
OPEN s1;
FETCH FIRST FROM s1;
FETCH LAST FROM s1;
-- Other fetch methods...
CLOSE s1;
END;<br>
